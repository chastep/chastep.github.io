Wha...? What's this?!?!

[![AWS Cert](/media/aws-certified-developer-associate.png)](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/5cbd08ba-053a-4227-b4f2-0bc92becd24d/public_url)

My god...it's beautiful! So shiny. So clean!

I'm happy I passed, was a somewhat long process with some rescheduling and nail-biting, but overall a good learning experience. The certificate is a great addition to my professional resume and it'll aide me moving forward for any personal/hobby project as well. If I ever get a physical badge I will wear it with pride, but this will do for now ðŸ˜Ž

I appreciate everyone who helped me study, they are the real MVPs.

Onto the next thing, peace out y'all.
