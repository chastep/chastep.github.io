Blogs are ok. I've never been a big advocate for them, but I think it's important I start to catalog some thoughts. I built this blog using a few tools and articles I believe are efficient, robust, and fun to use/learn from. Every tool comes with some pros and cons of course, I'll try to highlight some easy wins (for myself and for the community that utilizes them) in the list below:

## Tools:

### [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/):
- Ripped right from the main page, "Gatsby is a React-based open source framework for creating websites and apps.". This a big win for me because I kinda already know React! Oh boy!
- I was drawn to Gatsby because of its promise of "performance, scalability, and security". These points directly relate to 3 main points for myself: [server-side rendering](https://medium.com/@quinn.royston/server-side-rendering-213f66b27229), [extremely fast build times](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/), and [built-in plugin enhancements](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/). Seriously, there are a crazy amount of plugins. Big shout out to [Alexander Shelepenok](https://github.com/alxshelepenok) for the [gatsby starter](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) this whole blog is literally built from. Very fun community that I hope to contribute to one day.

### [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Not much to say here besides that I've been using this IDE for about a year now and I really like it. The plugins are a very nice plus that highlight the community aspect of the application.

## Articles

- I'm just going to link them all directly because I learned a lot from each.

That's it for now. Again, I'm not great at this blogging stuff, but the above is a quick distillation of resources that help me build this. Very cool, be safe and be well.
