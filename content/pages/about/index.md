Hi, my name is Chase. Iâ€™ve been doing this dev thing for awhile now and my goal is to learn something new everyday.

![me in tux by lake](./headshot.jpeg)

_Used to have a pic of a wave here cause I like waves, but for now its just me in a tux by one of my favorite lakes in one of my favorite places._

I hope to use this blog as a way to post about anything and everything that interests me. It will be unbiased and I hope to provide content that makes me happy. Enjoy it if you enjoy it.
